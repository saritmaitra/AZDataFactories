# Linked services are like connection strings that define the connectivity information that Azure Data Factory needs to connect to the respective
# external data stores or compute engines

# EXAMPLE:
# The following linked service is an Azure Storage linked service. Here, the type is set to AzureStorage. The type properties for the Azure Storage
# linked service include a connection string. The ADF service uses this connection string to connect to the data store at runtime.
