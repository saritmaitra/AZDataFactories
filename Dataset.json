* dataset is the representation or reference to the actual data in the data store.
# For a data movement activity like a Copy activity, we can set a source and a sink dataset accordingly for the data movement.
# Fore example, copy data from Azure Blob Storage to a SQL database, you create two linked services: Azure Blob Storage and Azure SQL
# Database. Then, create two datasets: an Azure Blob dataset (which refers to the Azure Storage linked service) and an Azure SQL table dataset
# (which refers to the Azure SQL Database linked service). The Azure Storage and Azure SQL Database linked services contain connection
# strings that Azure Data Factory uses at runtime to connect to your Azure storage and Azure SQL database, respectively. The Azure Blob dataset
# specifies the blob container and blob folder that contains the input blobs in your Blob Storage. The Azure SQL table dataset specifies the SQL table
# in our SQL database to which the data is to be copied.
