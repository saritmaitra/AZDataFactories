ADF:

Activity defines the action to be performed.
A linked service defines a target data store or a compute service. 
An integration runtime provides the bridge between the activity and the linked services. It is referenced by the linked service and provides the
compute environment where the activity either runs or gets dispatched from. This way, the activity can be performed in the region closest possible
to the target data store or compute service in the most performant way while meeting security and compliance needs.

Azure IR:

The Azure integration runtime can be used for data movement and orchestration of data stores and compute services that are in the public
network. For example, if weâ€™re copying data from public endpoints like Amazon S3 to Azure Blob in a public environment, then the Azure IR
works well and provide you with cloud scale for big data movement.

We can set how many data integration units to use on the Copy activity, and the compute size of the Azure IR is elastically scaled
up accordingly without we having to explicitly adjust the size of the Azure IR.

LIMITATIONS:

The only drawback of the Azure IR is it cannot be used if our data stores are behind a firewall because then it would require inbound access
through the firewall, which may not be agreeable.
