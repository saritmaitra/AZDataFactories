# We can create a dependency between two activities in ADF. This is extremely helpful while you want to run downstream activities on certain
# conditions or dependencies. ADF lets us build the dependencies based on various conditions such as Succeeded, Failed, Skipped, and Completed.
# For example, when Activity A is successfully executed, then run Activity B. If Activity A fails, then run Activity C. Activity B depends on Activity A succeeding.
